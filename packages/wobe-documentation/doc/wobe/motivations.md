# Motivations

The idea behind creating Wobe arises from several factors. In my experience working with various TypeScript-based web frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Hono, and more recently, Elysia, I've noticed certain trends. On one hand, there are frameworks with extensive features but often outdated or complex to use, lacking in performance. On the other hand, there are newer frameworks focused on speed but sometimes sacrificing simplicity or ecosystem. While performance is crucial, real-world scenarios often reveal that simplicity is equally important for long-term project success.

Wobe aims to strike a balance by providing a comprehensive toolkit, featuring a diverse array of hooks and common plugins tailored to address a variety of use cases. Wobe take all the advantages of any other frameworks without the inconvenient. It is designed to be **lightweight**, **fast**, and **simple** to use, with a focus on developer productivity and performance.
