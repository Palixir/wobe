# Motivations

The idea behind creating Wobe arises from several factors. In my experience working with various TypeScript-based web frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Hono, and more recently, Elysia, I've noticed certain trends. On one hand, there are frameworks with extensive features but often outdated or complex to use, that could lacking in performance. On the other hand, there are newer frameworks focused on speed but sometimes sacrificing simplicity or ecosystem. While performance is crucial, real-world scenarios often reveal that then http benchmark doesn't indicate the real performance. Because in the facts, the handler and the business logic take always more time to execute than find the route and call all the middlewares. So on, the simplicity and a good eco-system is for me the best indicator for a robust web framework.

Wobe aims to strike a balance by providing a comprehensive toolkit, featuring a diverse array of hooks and common plugins tailored to address a variety of use cases. Wobe take all the advantages of any other frameworks without the inconvenient. It is designed to be **simple** to use, **lightweight**, **fast**, with a focus on developer productivity.
